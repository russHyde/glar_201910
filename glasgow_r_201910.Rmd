```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Why use R instead of {...}?

## We all get stuck

Ask actual people:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
getting_stuck_data <- data.frame(
  from = "Ask people",
  to = c(
    "twitter.com", "rfordatasci.com", "stack-overflow", "biostars",
    "github"
  )
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
getting_stuck_plot <- networkD3::simpleNetwork(
  getting_stuck_data,
  height = "600px", width = "600px",
  linkDistance = 100, opacity = 0.9, fontSize = 24, nodeColour = "#499382"
)
```

```{r}
getting_stuck_plot
```
