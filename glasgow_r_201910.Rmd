```{r setup, include=FALSE}

## Why use R instead of {...}?

## We all get stuck

Ask actual people:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data <- data.frame(
  from = "Ask people",
  to = c("twitter.com", "rfordatasci.com", "stack-overflow", "biostars",
"github")
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
p <- networkD3::simpleNetwork(data, height = "600px", width = "600px",
  linkDistance = 100, opacity = 0.9, fontSize = 24, nodeColour = "#499382")
```

```{r}
p
```

## Let's do something for the community ...

[`tidygraph`](https://github.com/thomasp85/tidygraph)

[`ggraph`](https://github.com/thomasp85/ggraph)

Example: network analysis with `tidygraph` and plotting with `ggraph`

---

```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)

# `tidygraph` creates / analyses graph datastructures (nodes
# & edges)

gr1 <- create_notable("bull") %>%
  # .. `dplyr`-like syntax for modifying components
  mutate(name = letters[1:5])

gr2 <- create_ring(5) %>%
  mutate(name = letters[4:8])
```

---

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.height=4}
# `ggraph` uses `ggplot2`-like syntax for plotting graphs
gr1 %>%
  bind_graphs(gr2) %>%
  ggraph(layout = "kk") +
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point(size = 8, colour = "steelblue") +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), colour = "white", vjust = 0.4) +
  theme_graph()
```
