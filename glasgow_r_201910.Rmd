## Why use R instead of {...}?

## Me & R

Experimental things on github (@russHyde)

- [dupree](https://github.com/russHyde/dupree)
    - duplicate code detection (built on `lintr`)

- [polyply](https://github.com/russHyde/polyply)
    - extend dplyr verbs to sets of data-frames

- bioinformatics stuff

## Let's do something for the community ...

[`tidygraph`](https://github.com/thomasp85/tidygraph)

[`ggraph`](https://github.com/thomasp85/ggraph)

Example: network analysis with `tidygraph` and plotting with `ggraph`

---

```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)

# `tidygraph` creates / analyses graph datastructures (nodes
# & edges)

gr1 <- create_notable("bull") %>%
  # .. `dplyr`-like syntax for modifying components
  mutate(name = letters[1:5])

gr2 <- create_ring(5) %>%
  mutate(name = letters[4:8])
```

---

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.height=4}
# `ggraph` uses `ggplot2`-like syntax for plotting graphs
gr1 %>% bind_graphs(gr2) %>%
  ggraph(layout = "kk") +
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point(size = 8, colour = "steelblue") +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), colour = "white", vjust = 0.4) +
  theme_graph()
```
